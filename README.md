- Overview Map: Indicates the viewpoint of the main map/scene view.
- Scalebar: Shows a ruler with units proportional to the map's current scale.
- Template Picker: Shows feature templates for a collection of feature layers.

## Instructions

The toolkit library jar is hosted on https://bintray.com/esri/arcgis.

To add the dependency to your project using Gradle:
```groovy
ext {
  arcgisVersion = "100.8.0"
}

repositories {
  maven {
      url 'https://esri.bintray.com/arcgis'
  }
}

dependencies {
  // toolkit
  compile "com.esri.arcgisruntime:arcgis-java-toolkit:$arcgisVersion"
  // api
  compile "com.esri.arcgisruntime:arcgis-java:$arcgisVersion" 
  // native libraries
  natives "com.esri.arcgisruntime:arcgis-java-jnilibs:$arcgisVersion"
  natives "com.esri.arcgisruntime:arcgis-java-resources:$arcgisVersion"
}

task copyNatives(type: Copy) {
  description = "Copies the arcgis native libraries into USER_HOME/.arcgis for development."
  group = "build"
  configurations.natives.asFileTree.each {
    from(zipTree(it))
  }
  into "${System.properties.getProperty("user.home")}/.arcgis/$arcgisVersion"
}
```

## Requirements

The toolkit requires the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Java. Refer to the Instructions section above if you are using Gradle.
